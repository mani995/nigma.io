# Nigma
A developer community for students studying computing related courses, entry level developers wanting to broaden their horizons and senior developers that want to help others that were once in the position they were in. The Nigma community can be found on http://nigma.io and operates a [closed facebook community group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nigmaio).

# Dedicated to keeping students up-to-date on the latest skills, tech meetups and career prospects such as internships & graduate schemes.

Nigma was created through the frustration of one Computer Science student that had always wanted to learn, but didn't know exactly what to learn. Our main aim is to try and bridge the gap between those leaving academia and those about to enter the workplace. With NI employers in high demand for top developers, we want to help empower students to help them reach their full potential.
